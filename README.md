# jQuery Salary Calculator
This is an application that records employee salaries and adds salaries up to report monthly costs. 

The input form collects _employee first name, last name, ID number, job title, annual salary_.
The 'Submit' button collects the form information, stores the information to calculate monthly costs, appends information to the DOM and clears the input fields when submitted. Then, the monthly costs are calculated using the stored information and appended to the to DOM. If the total monthly cost exceeds $20,000, the total monthly cost turns red.

The delete button allows users to remove employees from the DOM and updates the monthly total accordingly.
